#Team activity for unit 3

"""
Write a program to compute the areas of three different shapes. Prompt for the necessary information, 
then compute and display the area, as follows:

Make sure that your program can appropriately handle decimal values as well as whole numbers.

Square—The area is the length of a side squared.

Rectangle—The area is the length multiplied by the width.

Circle—The area is Pi (you can use 3.14) multiplied by the radius squared.
